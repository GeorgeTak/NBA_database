# NBA_database

With the use of NBA's API and tkinter library, I  designed a database for teams and players.
-Copy & paste each team's code to see its current roster 
-Copy & paste each player's code to see his career stats
-Each team's players can be sorted by weight or height
-Save a player's career stats into an excel file
-Predict and see player's stats for the next season(2024-2025)
-Save player's predicted stats into an excel file
